        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Healthcare fraud is a major issue that costs billions of dollars each year. This problem includes fraudulent billing practices by some medical providers, leading to increased healthcare expenses and tarnishing the reputation of honest providers. Recognizing the scale and impact of this issue is crucial for maintaining trust in the healthcare system.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Healthcare fraud is a major issue that costs billions of dollars each year. This problem includes fraudulent billing practices by some medical providers, leading to increased healthcare expenses and tarnishing the reputation of honest providers. Recognizing the scale and impact of this issue is crucial for maintaining trust in the healthcare system.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-overview">
        <h2>Data Overview</h2>
        <p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) offers key information about health services. This includes data on hospital visits (Inpatient Data), services people get without staying in the hospital (Outpatient Data), and personal details about the people who receive Medicare and Medicaid, like age and if they qualify for these programs (Beneficiary Details Data). This information helps us understand who uses these services, what kind of care they get, and how to make these programs better for everyone.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
        <p>Hospital admission and outpatient visit records are merged on matching elements. Beneficiary information is then aligned with this data via individual IDs. In the final step, healthcare provider details are incorporated using provider IDs, creating a comprehensive dataset for insights.</p>

        <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
        <p>
In data preprocessing, patient ages are calculated from birthdates, and claim times plus hospital stays are analyzed for trends. Data is then normalized, relevant features selected for better model accuracy, and categories are turned into numbers.</p>
